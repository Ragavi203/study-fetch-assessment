# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

This document provides instructions for setting up and pushing your StudyFetch Assessment project to GitHub.

## Prerequisites

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your machine
2. A [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)
3. The StudyFetch Assessment codebase on your local machine

## Setup Steps

### 1. Initialize Git Repository (if not already done)

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd study-fetch-assessment

# Initialize a new git repository
git init
```

### 2. Add .gitignore File

Ensure you have a `.gitignore` file with the following content:

```
# dependencies
/node_modules
/.pnp
.pnp.js

# testing
/coverage

# next.js
/.next/
/out/

# production
/build

# misc
.DS_Store
*.pem

# debug
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# local env files
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local

# vercel
.vercel

# typescript
*.tsbuildinfo
next-env.d.ts

# PDF uploads
public/uploads/*
!public/uploads/.gitkeep
```

### 3. Create a New GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and login
2. Click the "+" button in the top right, then "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "study-fetch-assessment")
4. Choose visibility (public or private)
5. Do NOT initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license
6. Click "Create repository"

### 4. Prepare Your Local Repository

```bash
# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit for StudyFetch Assessment"
```

### 5. Link to GitHub Repository

```bash
# Add the remote GitHub repository (replace with your actual GitHub URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/study-fetch-assessment.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v
```

### 6. Push Your Code to GitHub

```bash
# Push to the main branch
git push -u origin main
```

### 7. Verify Repository

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. Ensure all files were uploaded correctly
3. Check that sensitive files (like `.env`) are not included

## Repository Structure Best Practices

1. **Documentation**:
   - `README.md`: Project overview, features, and setup instructions
   - `.env.example`: Template for environment variables
   - `VERCEL-DEPLOYMENT.md`: Vercel deployment instructions
   
2. **Code Organization**:
   - Keep the folder structure clean and logical
   - Use meaningful file names
   - Include comments for complex logic

3. **Branching Strategy (for future development)**:
   - `main`: Stable production code
   - `develop`: Integration branch for ongoing development
   - Feature branches: For new features (e.g., `feature/voice-integration`)

## Collaborator Access

If you need to give access to collaborators:
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings"
3. Select "Collaborators" from the left sidebar
4. Click "Add people"
5. Enter their GitHub username or email

## Submitting for Review

To submit your completed assessment:
1. Ensure all code is pushed to GitHub
2. Send the repository URL to the designated contact
3. Include any additional notes or instructions

Remember to make your repository public or add the assessor as a collaborator if it's private.
