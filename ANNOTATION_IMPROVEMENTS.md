## Study Fetch PDF Annotation System Improvements

This document summarizes the improvements made to the annotation system.

### Key Issues Addressed

1. **Annotation Command Parsing**
   - Made regex patterns more flexible to handle various formats and whitespace variations
   - Added support for alternative formats (with colons and commas)
   - Improved handling of color parameters

2. **Stream Event Processing**
   - Enhanced buffer management for commands split across chunks
   - Added stream ID tracking to reset buffers for new conversations
   - Implemented better logging of stream events and annotation parsing

3. **System Prompts**
   - Updated system prompts with clearer instructions about annotation formats
   - Added explicit examples with proper spacing and parameter order
   - Made formatting requirements more explicit

4. **Debugging Tools**
   - Added DebugOverlay component for real-time monitoring
   - Created annotation-test page for automated testing
   - Built annotation-debugger tool for manual testing and analysis

5. **UI Improvements**
   - Added AnnotationVisualizer for real-time previewing of annotations
   - Enhanced logging throughout the system
   - Added more robust error handling

### Usage

1. **Debug Overlay**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+D` while using the application to show the debug overlay.
2. **Test Pages**:
   - `/test/annotation-test`: Automated test suite for annotation formats
   - `/test/annotation-debugger`: Interactive tool for manual testing

### Technical Details

The main improvements to the annotation parsing system:

```typescript
// More flexible regex patterns for highlights
const highlightRegex = /\[\s*HIGHLIGHT\s+(\d+)\s+(\d+)\s+(\d+)\s+(\d+)\s+(\d+)(?:\s+color="([^"]+)")?\s*\]/g;

// Support for alternative format with colons and commas
const highlightAltRegex = /\[\s*HIGHLIGHT\s*:\s*(\d+)\s*,\s*(\d+)\s*,\s*(\d+)\s*,\s*(\d+)\s*,\s*(\d+)(?:\s*,\s*color="([^"]+)")?\s*\]/g;

// Improved buffer management for split commands
const textBufferRef = useRef<string>('');
const commandBufferRef = useRef<string>('');
const streamIdRef = useRef<string | null>(null);

// If this is a new stream, clear the buffer
if (currentStreamId && streamIdRef.current !== currentStreamId) {
  console.log(`LiveHighlighter: New stream detected. Clearing buffer.`);
  commandBufferRef.current = '';
  textBufferRef.current = '';
  streamIdRef.current = currentStreamId;
}

// Process chunks with detailed logging
console.log(`LiveHighlighter: Raw chunk received (${chunk.length} chars): "${chunk.substring(0, 100)}${chunk.length > 100 ? '...' : ''}"`);
```

### System Prompt Update

The system prompt was updated to provide clearer instructions about annotation formats:

```
2. ANNOTATIONS - Use these EXACT command formats to highlight information:
   - Highlight: [HIGHLIGHT ${currentPage} 100 150 200 50] (page, x, y, width, height)
   - Circle: [CIRCLE ${currentPage} 100 150 50] (page, x, y, radius)
   - With color: [HIGHLIGHT ${currentPage} 100 150 200 50 color="rgba(255,0,0,0.5)"]
   Important: Always include the square brackets and proper spacing between parameters.
   Always include at least one annotation in your response and explain what you're highlighting.
```

This ensures that the AI model consistently produces properly formatted annotation commands that can be parsed reliably.
